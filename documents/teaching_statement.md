# Ryan Abernathey: Teaching Statement #

My teaching up to this point involves two classes: _Introduction to Physical
Oceaography (EESC 4295)_ and _Geophyiscal Fluid Dynamics (EESC/APPH 4210)_. I
began teaching Physical Oceanography in Fall 2013 (my first semester at
Columbia) and continued through Fall 2015. This class is co-taught with Arnold
Gordon. The enrollments for each semester were 14, 17, and 21. I taught
GFD, by myself, in Spring 2015 and 2016. The enrollments were 17 and 14.

My teaching portfolio is about to change significantly. In Fall 2016, I will be
on Parental Workload Relief and will not teach. In Spring 2017, I will take
over the teaching of _Ocean Dynamics (EESC G6930)_, an upper level graduate
course previously taught by Dick Ou. Although I will retain the course number,
the course itself will be brand new, reflecting my own perspective on the
subject. In Fall 2017, I will also co-teach a new course called _Climate
Modeling_ together with Lorenzo Polvani. Presumably I will also return to
teaching Physical Oceanography this semester, significantly increasing my
overall teaching load.

On top of my formal teaching, every year I have offered an informal "bootcamp"
entitled _Scientific Computing with Python_. I have experimented with different
formats, but each year I have had approx. 80 attendees. This speaks to the
deep demand for education in computing within DEES and Lamont. This year,
the initial workshop blossomed into a weekly study group exploring different
aspects of scientific computing and visualization, with about 15 regular
attendees. In retrospect, I should have turned this into an official seminar,
allowing the students (and myself) to receive credit for their participation.

I have great ambitions for my teaching. I sincerely enjoy teaching, and I am
eager to experiment with contemporary pedagogical techniques, including
active learning, flipped classrooms, and incorporating real data into teaching.
So far, the courses I have inherited have not been particularly amenable to such
methods. I look forward to developing my own new courses (Ocean Dynamics and
Climate Modeling) which will better reflect my interests, expertise, and
teaching philosophy.
